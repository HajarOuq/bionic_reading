There are 7 9ira2at (the reading), all from the prophet saws for each arabic dialect that existed at the time, like nafi3, 3assim, ibn kathir...

Each 9ira2a, has at least 1 riwaya (narration), which is what a rawi learned from the 9ari2, like hafs from 3assim, warsh from nafi3, and 9aloun from nafi3.

There are slight differences between all these riwayat and 9ira2at, but no change to the original meaning, and all of them are supposedly correct, so there is nothing to worry about.

The most spread in the world one is hafs, and warsh is mostly used in north africa.

The prophet saws used all of them.

The closest 9ira2at to the dialect of people from quraysh are nafi3, ibn kathir, abou aamr.

Omar heard Hisham ibn Hakim recite surat al fur9an in a different way, took him to the prophet saws and asked him about it, the prophet asked hisham to recite, then said "it was revealed like this", then asked omar to recite his version, then said "it was revealed like this", then added "Indeed, this Qur’an has been revealed in seven different ways, so recite it in the way that is easy for you."
